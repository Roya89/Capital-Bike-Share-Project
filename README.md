## Project Overview

**Capital Bikeshare Demand Analysis and Forecasting**

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting bike demand for Capital Bikeshare, a bike-sharing system serving Washington, D.C. Over the course of three weeks, the primary goals include data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series analysis, and linear regression to analyze bike usage patterns and build a predictive model that forecasts demand for bicycles.<br>

With a growing emphasis on environmental sustainability and health, bike-sharing programs like Capital Bikeshare play a crucial role in urban transportation. By reducing traffic congestion, supporting public transport connectivity, and lowering emissions, bike-sharing systems are increasingly popular as a short- to medium-distance travel solution.

## Dataset Details

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes bike rental data for Capital Bikeshare from 2021 to 2023, capturing temporal, geographical, environmental, and operational factors.
The datasets used for this project can be found [here](https://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data), including:

Hourly and Daily Datasets: Provide insights into trends by time of day, day of the week, and weather conditions.
Full Dataset: Contains details of every ride, useful for advanced analysis such as mapping techniques to visualize high and low demand areas.



## Key Sections

- #### Data Wrangling and Cleaning:
Handle missing values, correct inconsistencies, and prepare the dataset for further analysis. This step is essential due to the relatively raw nature of the dataset.

- #### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Analyze how factors such as time of day, day of the week, season, and weather conditions influence bike demand. EDA helps identify patterns and trends, providing a solid foundation for building predictive models.

- #### Time Series and Linear Regression Modeling: 
Use time series analysis and linear regression to understand temporal trends and make demand predictions, especially focused on night-time hours.

- #### Machine Learning Forecasting Model: 
Develop and validate models to predict bike demand, aiming for high accuracy (targeting 90%) during off-peak hours. This includes:

- #### Cross-validation techniques to ensure model robustness.
Potential use of multiple models to compare performance and select the best one.
Mapping and Visualization: Leverage the full dataset to create geographic visualizations, showing areas of high and low demand. This insight is valuable for operational decisions such as bike redistribution.

- #### Recommendations and Insights: Based on the model predictions, outline recommendations for Capital Bikeshare. This may include:

Real-time demand updates to adjust bike availability dynamically.
Optimized maintenance schedules based on forecasted demand patterns.
